This is a personal project created for the purpose of monitoring
temperature and humidity in an enclosed space (i.e. a safe), and logging data to a channel on thingspeak.com.

It is built upon the Raspberry Pi and includes the following components:

	- Raspberry Pi Model B, rev 2 (512MB)
	- AM2302 (wired DHT22) temperature-humidity sensor 
		(http://www.adafruit.com/product/393)
	- USB WiFi (802.11b/g/n) Module with Antenna for Raspberry Pi
		(http://www.adafruit.com/product/1030)
	- Adafruit Blue&White 16x2 LCD+Keypad Kit for Raspberry Pi
		(http://www.adafruit.com/product/1115)

The AM2302 requires drivers written by Adafruit, which can be obtained from the following github repository: git://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code.git

The initial version of this program will utilize the pre-compiled Adafruit_DHT program found under  ~/Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code/Adafruit_DHT_Driver/

A future revision may feature direct communication with the AM2302 instead of utilizing OS calls to the Adafruit_DHT program via subprocess.check_output().

The program may be started by issuing the following command:

sudo python humidity.py <api_key>

where <api_key> is the channel API key issued by thingspeak.com
